# Sales_Analysis

This project is about understanding and analyzing the sales data of a small supermarket using Python programming. Every time a customer buys something, it creates data. This data is saved in a file called a CSV file, which looks like a simple table. Instead of going through the data manually, we use Python to read it and find useful information.

How it works:

• Uploaded CSV in Google Colab

 • Used Python to read the file
 
 • Calculated total sales (Quantity × Price)
 
 • Found total revenue
 
 • Found top-selling product
 
 • Analyzed category-wise performance
